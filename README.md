Phase I - Foundation
 * Solve invariant equation
 * Set up CI
 * Planning and specification
 * Non-parallel contract state machine
 * Metrics APIs

Phase II - Parallelism
 * Parallelize contract endpoints
 * Update metrics APIs to handle parallelized contract

Phase III - Integration
 * Deploy and test contract on testnet
 * Create administrative API for parallelized contract instances
 * Fine tuning numerical analysis

Concurrently with this work, we will do security, ops, and auditing work. Roadmap for this work is TBD.
